# Installation

neo4j-atag requires Neo4j >= 5.0.
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/THM-Graphs/neo4j-atag/releases) and copy the jar file to the `plugins` directory of your Neo4j installation.

If you use the Neo4j Desktop, you can install the plugin via the "3 dots" menu.
Use `Open folder` and `plugins` to copy the jar file to the correct directory.

For a docker based Neo4j deployment you can mount the jar file to the plugins directory.

A restart of Neo4j is required to load the plugin.
